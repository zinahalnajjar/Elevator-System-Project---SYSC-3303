 Dear user,
 Thank you for using our elevator program which 
 will allow you to simulate an operating elevator!

 Setup:
 Download the zip file from Github or create an 
 empty project and pull the project. Once it has been
 pulled successfully, go to package explorer and follow the path
 "Elevator System-> src -> default package -> simulation". This will
 open the main class and allow you to run the program.
 
 Testing: 
 Test cases inside floorTest
  
 Breakdown of responsibilities iteration 1:
 Majority of work was done by everyone working on the code at the same time.
 Zinah Al-Najjar: Implementation of all classes, Sequence Diagram.
 Mack Wallace:Implementation of all classes, Testing.
 Vilmos Feher: Implementation of all classes, Sequence Diagram.
 Shawaiz Khan: UML Diagram, Documentation.
 Faris Abo-Mazeed: Worked on test case
 
 Breakdown of responsibilities iteration 2:
 Majority of work was done by everyone working on the state machines
 Zinah Al-Najjar: State machine diagrams, code implementation
 Mack Wallace: State machine diagrams, code implementation
 Vilmos Feher: State machine diagrams
 Shawaiz Khan: State machine diagrams, UML Diagram
