 Setup:
 Download the zip file from Github or create an 
 empty project and pull the project. Once it has been
 pulled successfully, go to package explorer and follow the path
 "Elevator System-> src -> default package -> simulation". This will
 open the main class and allow you to run the program.
 
 Testing: 
 
 to be added
 
 Breakdown of responsibilities: 
 Majority of work was done by everyone working on the code at the same time.
 Zinah Al-Najjar: Implementation of all classes, Sequence Diagram.
 Mack Wallace:Implementation of all classes, Testing.
 Vilmos Feher: Implementation of all classes, Sequence Diagram.
 Shawaiz Khan: UML Diagram, Documentation.
